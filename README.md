# Browser Privacy

Here are the pluigins used for today's lecture. I have divided up the plugins into categories based on how difficult the program or plugin is to use. "Easier" plugins will typically break less of the Web under normal usage. 

Basic (everyone should use some version of these with minimal breaking)
---
- [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock)
- [DeCentralEyes](https://git.synz.io/Synzvato/decentraleyes)
- DNS blocklists (replace your ISP's DNS provider with one of these)
	- [Adguard DNS](https://adguard-dns.io/en/welcome.html)
	- [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net)
	- [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io) ($)

Intermediate (not for everyone -- some technical knowledge needed and some breaking may happen)
---
- [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers)
- [CleanLinks](https://github.com/Cimbali/CleanLinks)
- [Cookie AutoDelete](https://github.com/Cookie-AutoDelete/Cookie-AutoDelete)
- [User-Agent Switcher and Manager](https://github.com/ray-lothian/UserAgent-Switcher)
- [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org)

Advanced (will probably break something or more technical knowledge needed)
---
- [NoScript](https://github.com/hackademix/noscript) (will break a lot of the Web with default settings)
- [FoxyProxy](https://github.com/foxyproxy/firefox-extension) (proxy manager for Firefox/Chrome. I used Surge in the demo)

Expert (only if you really want control over your devices -- not for newbs)
---
- [Surge](https://nssurge.com) (MacOS / iOS only) ($$$)
